Day 1: We gathered every exam paper and mark scheme and organised them neatly so nothing goes missing.
Day 2: We pulled the text and pictures out of those papers so they’re easy to browse without opening each PDF.
Day 3: We read the diagrams and charts, wrote plain descriptions for them, and cleaned up any messy text.
Day 4: We built a small reference set of diagrams and wrote human notes so we know what “good” looks like.
Day 5: We taught a helper model how to understand those diagrams using the human notes as examples.
Day 6: We turned every exam question into tidy records that link the question, answer, and any images together.
Day 7: We created a first batch of multiple-choice questions, reviewed them, and kept the 460 best ones.
Day 8: We hooked up a local AI to draft new questions and logged where its answers still fell short.
Day 9: We built an automatic checker that cleans the question files, spots broken entries, and shows topic gaps.
Day 10: We’ll automatically bundle the approved questions into the training format and slice them into practice sets.
Day 11: We’ll let the AI train on that cleaned set while recording progress so we can see how it learns.
Day 12: We’ll run automatic report cards on the trained AI to see where it still struggles.
Day 13: We’ll have the AI draft fresh questions for the weak spots and prep a simple review tool.
Day 14: We’ll compare the trained versions, package everything, and set up an easy station for you to give feedback.
