Day 1 recap:
- organised every exam board into tidy folders (kept question paper + mark scheme pairs together)
- logged what we have in `data/README.md`, showing years covered and any gaps
- deleted old pre-2017 papers and the unused WJEC Unit 5 folder so we only keep the years we agreed on

Day 2 recap:
- built the PDF extractor script and installed the tools so we can pull text + diagrams
- ran it on a fresh sample to check outputs, then on the whole dataset
- spotted which papers failed (weâ€™ll skip dodgy MA files and fix image colour handling next)
