# Physics Past-Paper Coverage

This table tracks the past-paper PDFs and mark schemes stored under `data/pdfs/`. Question-paper/mark-scheme counts ignore ancillary files (e.g. data sheets), though the total column reflects every PDF in that folder. Model answers (`MA`) are counted with mark schemes. Update this sheet whenever new papers land or gaps are resolved.

## Handling and Security

- Store the `data/` directory on encrypted storage (BitLocker or equivalent) if the papers are not already public. Document who has access and keep backups offline.
- Do not sync `data/pdfs/` to GitHub; track acquisition steps here instead.
- When new sets arrive, update this README before running extraction scripts.
