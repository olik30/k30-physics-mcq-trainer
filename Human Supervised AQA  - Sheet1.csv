From these points, the apparatus is aligned so that O lies at the intersection of two dashed reference lines extending horizontally and vertically across the diagram. On the right-hand side of the figure, along the horizontal dashed line, there are two points marked A and B, each enclosed by a small circular or oval outline. These represent detectors or receivers positioned at different points in the wave field generated by the sources at P and Q. Point A lies directly to the right of O, while point B is vertically above A along the other dashed reference line. The signal generator, shown as a rectangular box on the left, provides an alternating output signal to both sources P and Q, which are likely loudspeakers or transducers producing coherent waves (sound or microwaves). The equal wiring connections indicate that both sources receive the same signal and therefore emit waves of the same frequency and phase. This arrangement represents a two-source interference experiment, where the waves from P and Q overlap, creating regions of constructive and destructive interference at different positions along the plane — particularly at points like A and B. Measurements at these points would show variations in signal amplitude depending on the path difference between the two sources.

AQA_graph_022.png,A graph plotting intensity against wavelength.,"The diagram labelled Figure 2 shows a spectrum graph displaying how the intensity of light varies with wavelength. The horizontal axis represents wavelength in nanometres (nm), ranging from 300 nm to 700 nm, covering the ultraviolet to visible light region. The vertical axis shows intensity in arbitrary units, increasing from 0.0 at the bottom to 1.0 at the top. A continuous black line traces the variation of intensity across the wavelength range, forming a series of sharp peaks and troughs. These peaks correspond to specific wavelengths where the emission is strongest, indicating distinct spectral lines produced by the source. The tallest peaks occur around the shorter wavelengths (approximately 380–420 nm), showing that the source emits most strongly in the violet–blue region of the spectrum. Two of the peaks are marked X and Y, with Y being the highest, located just to the right of X. Their close spacing suggests they arise from two neighbouring transitions of similar energy. Several other smaller peaks appear at higher wavelengths around 470 nm, 520 nm, and 650 nm, representing weaker emission lines in the green and red parts of the spectrum. The graph overall indicates that the light source emits discrete wavelengths rather than a continuous spectrum, characteristic of a gas discharge or atomic emission process. The positions and relative heights of the peaks can be used to identify the element or elements present, while the grid background provides precise wavelength measurement for comparison against known spectral data.",,,,"The diagram labelled Figure 2 presents a graph of intensity against wavelength, used to analyse spectral emission.

AQA_graph_023.png,A mechanical with a spindle connecting to a rotatable plate adjacent to a fixed plate separated by an air gap.,"The diagram labelled Figure 1 shows a rotating-plate capacitor consisting of two semicircular metal plates separated by an air gap. The fixed plate is stationary, while the rotatable plate is mounted on a spindle, allowing it to pivot about its central axis. The spindle is represented as a cylindrical rod extending outward from the plates, and an arrow around it indicates the direction of rotation. Between the two plates, a small air gap is maintained, which acts as the dielectric medium of the capacitor. As the rotatable plate turns, the overlapping area between the two semicircular plates changes. This variation is represented by the angle θ (theta), which measures the angular displacement of the rotatable plate relative to the fixed one. When θ increases or decreases, the effective capacitance of the system changes because capacitance is directly proportional to the overlapping area and inversely proportional to the separation (the air gap). Therefore, by adjusting θ, the capacitance can be varied smoothly without altering the physical spacing between the plates. This type of mechanism is commonly used in variable capacitors for tuning circuits, such as in radios or oscillators, where precise control of capacitance is required.

AQA_graph_024.png,,"The diagram labelled Figure 6 illustrates an experimental setup used to investigate the magnetic force between two parallel current-carrying wires. The figure is divided into two sections: an electrical circuit schematic at the top and a physical apparatus diagram below it. In the top section, the circuit consists of a cell or power supply, an ammeter (A) for measuring current, and a variable resistor or rheostat symbol, allowing the current in the circuit to be adjusted. This setup provides a controllable direct current (I) that is supplied to the two wires in the lower diagram. In the lower section, two parallel horizontal wires, labelled wire X and wire Y, are shown. The lower wire (X) is mounted on a pan balance, represented at the bottom of the figure, while the upper wire (Y) is suspended a small vertical distance d above it. Both wires are of equal length L and carry identical currents I, but in opposite directions, as indicated by the arrows — current flows to the right through wire X and to the left through wire Y. The two wires are connected via terminal blocks at each end, which ensure electrical contact and mechanical support. The pan beneath the lower wire measures small changes in apparent weight caused by the magnetic interaction between the wires. When currents flow in opposite directions, the wires repel each other, and this force slightly alters the reading on the balance. By adjusting the current with the variable resistor and recording the change in balance reading, the experiment can be used to calculate the force per unit length (F/L) between the wires, given by the magnetic interaction equation  The setup demonstrates the magnetic force between current-carrying conductors, a fundamental principle used to define the ampere and to explore the relationship between current, distance, and magnetic field strength.",,,,"The diagram labelled Figure 6 shows an apparatus for measuring the force between two parallel current-carrying wires.

AQA_graph_025.png,,"The diagram labelled Figure 2 shows an electrical circuit used to measure the potential difference across two resistors connected in series. On the left side of the diagram, there is a power supply with an electromotive force (emf) of 1.62 V, represented by a cell symbol with its positive terminal at the top. A switch S is connected in series with the power supply, allowing the circuit to be opened or closed to control the flow of current. From the positive terminal of the cell, a wire leads to point X on the right-hand side of the circuit, where two resistors are connected vertically in series. The upper resistor has a resistance of 2.2 Ω, and the lower resistor has a resistance of 6.8 Ω, joined end-to-end between points X and Y. A voltmeter, symbolised by a circle with the letter V, is connected in parallel across the two resistors — between the top junction (at point X) and the bottom junction (at point Y). This placement allows it to measure the potential difference across the entire resistor combination. The negative terminal of the power supply is connected to point Y, completing the circuit. When the switch S is closed, current flows from the positive terminal of the 1.62 V supply through the resistors, creating a voltage drop across them that the voltmeter measures. Since the resistors are in series, the same current passes through both, and the total resistance of the pair is the sum of their individual values (2.2 Ω + 6.8 Ω = 9.0 Ω). The setup demonstrates the application of Ohm’s law and basic principles of series resistor combinations and voltage measurement, where the voltmeter must be connected in parallel to correctly record the total potential difference across both resistors.",,,,"The diagram labelled Figure 2 shows an electrical circuit containing a power supply of 1.62 V emf, a switch S, a voltmeter V, and two resistors of 2.2 Ω and 6.8 Ω connected in series between terminals X and Y.

The vertical axis is labelled V / V, representing potential difference in volts, and ranges from 0.10 V to 0.70 V. Each plotted point on the graph is marked with an ‘×’ symbol and includes a vertical error bar, indicating the uncertainty in the measured voltage values. The data points form a clear downward trend, showing that as the current increases, the voltage decreases. This inverse relationship suggests that the component or circuit under test exhibits internal resistance or a non-ohmic behaviour, where the potential difference drops due to increased current flow or energy losses within the source. The slope of the graph can be used to determine the internal resistance (r) and electromotive force (ε) of the power source if the data represents a cell or battery under load, based on the equation  In this case, the straight-line portion of the data implies a linear relationship consistent with that equation — the negative gradient corresponds to the internal resistance, while the extrapolated intercept on the voltage axis gives the emf of the source.
